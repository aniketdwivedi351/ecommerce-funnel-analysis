üìä Live Dashboard - Looker Studio
üìä Live Dashboard - Power BI (Optional)
üéØ Project Objective

The purpose of this project is to analyze customer behavior on an e-commerce cosmetics platform. By building a user funnel from product views to final purchases, the analysis identifies critical drop-off points in the customer journey.

The ultimate goal is to provide data-driven recommendations to:

Reduce cart abandonment

Improve overall conversion rates

Optimize marketing & engagement strategies

Enhance customer experience during checkout

üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies

Database: SQLite (via DB Browser for SQLite)

Query Language: SQL (for data cleaning, preprocessing, and funnel analysis)

Dashboarding & Visualization:

Google Looker Studio (interactive funnel dashboards, activity heatmaps)

Microsoft Power BI (advanced visualization & drill-down reports)

Version Control & Collaboration: Git & GitHub

üìÇ Project Workflow

Data Sourcing

Obtained a 20GB event dataset from Kaggle containing user activity logs (views, add-to-cart, checkout, purchases).

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (SQL)

Removed duplicates

Handled null/missing values

Standardized data types (timestamps, categorical values)

Created derived columns (Day of week, Hour of day, Session ID)

Example Queries Used:

-- Removing duplicates
CREATE TABLE events_cleaned AS
SELECT DISTINCT * FROM events;

-- Handling missing product IDs
DELETE FROM events_cleaned
WHERE product_id IS NULL;

-- Creating day of week from event timestamp
SELECT event_id,
       strftime('%w', event_time) AS day_of_week,
       strftime('%H', event_time) AS hour_of_day,
       event_type,
       user_id
FROM events_cleaned;


Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Funnel step analysis using SQL

Activity heatmap (Day vs. Hour)

Product-level performance (top-selling products, revenue contribution)

Example Funnel Query:

SELECT event_type,
       COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS users
FROM events_cleaned
WHERE event_type IN ('view', 'cart', 'purchase')
GROUP BY event_type
ORDER BY users DESC;
